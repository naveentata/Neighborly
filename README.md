## Neighborly
A discussion forum using AWS services.

"Neighborly" is a crowd-sourced community Q&A platform that aims to bring people together and facilitate the sharing of knowledge and resources within neighborhoods. It allows users to ask and answer questions about anything, from local events and recommendations to technical problems and general advice.
With "Neighborly", users can connect with their neighbors and other members of the community to get answers to their questions and help others with their own. The platform also includes features such as tags, upvoting, and commenting to help users find the most helpful and relevant information.
We believe that "Neighborly" has the potential to foster a sense of community and facilitate the sharing of valuable knowledge and resources within neighborhoods. It is our hope that through the use of this platform, people will be able to build stronger connections and support each other in their daily lives.
